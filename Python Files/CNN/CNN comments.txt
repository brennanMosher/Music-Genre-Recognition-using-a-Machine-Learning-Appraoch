Filters: Dimensionality of output space (# of filters applied)
Kernel_size: (height, width) of the 2D convolution window
	
Kernel size should be small since what separates spectrograms is small differences
Based on this link:
https://www.researchgate.net/post/How-do-we-choose-the-filters-for-the-convolutional-layer-of-a-Convolution-Neural-Network-CNN
Could either use 3x3 or 5x5 if we want think bigger differences between genres occur
	 
The greater the number of filters the higher test accuracy
As the number increases the complexity increases
Want to make it as large as possible without being unable to handle the code

A problem with the output feature maps is that they are sensitive to the location of the features in the input. 
	One approach to address this sensitivity is to down sample the feature maps.
	
	This line does the pooling
	
	Can either use 2 or 3. Maybe do some testing later to find which performs better
